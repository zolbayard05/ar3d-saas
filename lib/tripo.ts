 * Tripo API V3 client (image → 3D generation) and webhook verification.
 *
 * Field/endpoint names below are sourced from Tripo's V3 OpenAPI spec as
 * reconstructed at https://github.com/tryAGI/Tripo (a third-party SDK —
 * Tripo doesn't publish a public machine-readable schema, per that repo's
 * own spec header) and cross-checked against its webhook-signature source
 * and README. Confirmed, not guessed:
 *   - base URL, Bearer auth, POST /generation/image-to-model,
 *     POST /models/convert, response envelope { code, data }.
 *   - webhook signature scheme (Stripe-style t=/v1= HMAC-SHA256, see below).
 *   - there is NO per-request callback_url field anywhere in the spec — the
 *     webhook URL is configured out-of-band in the Tripo developer console.
 *     CLAUDE.md rule 12 describes "submit the job with a callback_url"; that
 *     doesn't match V3. Flagged to the user — the console-configured webhook
 *     is what actually delivers events here.
 * Not independently verified against a live account: the exact set of
 * `model` version strings still offered (TRIPO_MODEL_VERSION below is
 * configurable for exactly this reason) and real end-to-end payload
 * behavior. Confirm against a live task before relying on this in prod.

// glTF-only extension; ARKit's format has no equivalent), so constraining
// geometry at generation time is the only lever that helps *that* file at
// all. 200k faces is generous for a single piece of furniture at AR viewing
// distance — this is a starting point to tune against real output (one
// chair measured at 7.34 MB USDZ, under target, but geometry complexity
// varies enormously by object type: a lattice/high-poly object could still
// exceed rule 21's 8 MB target at this same face_limit — see

// specifically because this number is still a guess, not measured across

/**

 * shared AR links on the *models* bucket; this is a one-shot ingestion
 * fetch on a different, private bucket — not the same concern).
 *
 * Request shape confirmed against docs.tripo3d.ai's image-to-model (H3)
 * reference: `type` + `file.url` + `model_version`, not the `{model, input}`
 * shape this used to send (which happened to still be accepted under a
 * legacy/back-compat path, but silently ignores every quality parameter
 * below — there is no `texture_quality`/`geometry_quality`/`face_limit` on
 * that path). face_limit is set explicitly (see DEFAULT_FACE_LIMIT) because
 * USDZ can't be Draco-compressed after the fact, so this is the only real
 * lever for keeping that file under rule 21's size target.
 *
 * texture_quality is left at "standard" (the default, so simply omitted).
 * This was decided three times — see CLAUDE.md's decision log (rule on
 * texture quality) for the full numbers and the general lesson (a fixed-
 * pixel blur radius silently misbehaving across texture resolutions) before
 * touching this again. geometry_quality is left at "standard" too — that
 * lever affects mesh fidelity, not the texture defect, and face_limit
 * already controls the geometry budget directly.
